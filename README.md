JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication in Node.js involves the following steps:

1. **Token Generation**:  
   - User sends credentials (e.g., username and password) to the server.
   - Server validates credentials and generates a JWT using a secret key. The token typically includes a payload with user data and a signature for verification.

2. **Token Structure**:  
   - **Header**: Specifies the algorithm (e.g., HS256) and type (JWT).  
   - **Payload**: Contains claims (e.g., user ID, roles, or expiration).  
   - **Signature**: Ensures token integrity, created by hashing the header and payload with the secret key.

3. **Token Delivery**:  
   - The server sends the token back to the client, usually in the response body or a secure cookie.

4. **Client Usage**:  
   - The client stores the token (e.g., in localStorage or cookies) and includes it in the `Authorization` header as a `Bearer` token in subsequent requests.

5. **Token Verification**:  
   - The server validates the token on each request by verifying the signature and checking claims (e.g., expiration) to ensure authenticity and validity.

6. **Secure Practices**:  
   - Use HTTPS for secure transmission.
   - Set short token lifetimes and use refresh tokens for extended sessions.  
   - Implement blacklisting for token revocation when needed.
